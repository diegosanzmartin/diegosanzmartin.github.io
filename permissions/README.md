## üíª Usage

### Permissions and Roles Mode

In this mode, you can search for specific permissions and view the associated roles across GCP, AWS, and Azure platforms. Simply enter the permission name or role into the search bar, and the tool will display the matching results.

### üîç Regex Mode

Regex Mode allows you to search permissions and roles using regular expressions. This enables you to search for more complex patterns across permissions and roles, making it easier to find specific configurations.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Common Role Mode (Only for Permissions)

This mode is used to search for roles that are common to multiple permissions. Enter multiple permissions separated by commas (e.g., `permission1,permission2`), and the tool will display the roles that are associated with all listed permissions.

### üîÑ Multi Regex Mode (Only for Roles)

In Multi Regex Mode, you can perform two regex searches, and the tool will join the results. This allows for advanced role filtering based on multiple regex patterns.
